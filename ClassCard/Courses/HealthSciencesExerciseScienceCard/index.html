            This is a 2-year program that offers students the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills they will need in fields that assist patients with maintaining physical, mental, and emotional health. Students in this course will understand diet and exercise, as well as techniques to help patients recover from injury, illness, and disease. They will also learn about introductory health science topics such as employability skills, lifespan development, and ethical and legal standards. Students will learn basic kinesiology concepts to understand body mechanics and physiological functions of muscle movements. Students will gain knowledge of Anatomy and Physiology relating to exercise and how the body adapts to acute and chronic physical activity pertaining to sports and athletic performance. Systems covered include cellular metabolic processes, energy systems, and the effects of exercise on the respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, skeletal, and muscular systems. The course will also study the basic nutritional & wellness principles needed for optimal athletic and human performance. In addition, students will learn Medical Terminology, become certified in American Red Cross CPR & AED for the Professional Rescuer, and complete ten weeks of clinical observation in two career areas at the end of the second year. This course provides opportunities for students to participate in a work-based learning experience that combines classroom instruction with business and industry employment experiences. The goal is to prepare students with various skills for a changing workplace. Career preparation is relevant and rigorous while supporting student attainment of academic standards and effectively preparing students for college and career success.

                <h3>Why I Love Teaching CTE: <h4>The number one reason I love teaching at SICTC</br>
                    is because of the students. If I can help a student realize that they can be</br>
                    hired in to a quality career, be accepted to a post secondary school, or just have</br>
                    some skills and confidence to succeed in life, I see the students come in the first week</br>
                    or two, wanting to try something different they haven't tried before, or following up on a</br>
                    claim that they could learn with their hands here at SICTC. or even just wanting to get out</br>
                    of their home school and I try to turn them into excited, confident, skillful employees that</br>
                    employers around our area are starving for. That is why I love teaching at SICTC. I have the opportunity to change lives.</br>

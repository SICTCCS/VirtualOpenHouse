These students love hands-on work and would like to become part of the workforce as soon as they graduate. Teaching Graphic Communications/Digital Media is wonderful for these CTE students because they can go straight to the workforce or college if they choose. There are so many opportunities. I have had several of my students graduate from very prestigious design schools. I absolutely love seeing these students enjoy coming to school every day!</h4></h3>

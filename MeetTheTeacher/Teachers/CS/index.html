                <h2>About Me</h2></br>
                <h3>Name: <h4>Nic Bander</h4></h3></br>
                <h3>Program: <h4>Computer Science Software Development</h4></h3>
                <h3>College Degree: <h4>BS Civil Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</h4></h3>
                <h3>Career Start Year: <h4>2017</h4></h3>
                <h3>Certifications: <h4>Along with having an awesome work environment, I have the opportunity to teach my students in ways that they'll see after high school. We don't sit behind a desk and read a textbook, we learn by building programs and solving problems. In fact, our textbook is what developers use in the industry, Google...</h4></h3>
                <h3>Why I Love Teaching CTE: <h4>When I was 17 years old, I signed up for a Career & Technical Education course entitled Radio Broadcasting. This course was the catalyst for college scholarships, admittance into a Telecommunications program, numerous internships, and a competitive fellowship with the International Radio and Television Society. Since that time, my passion and life's work has been media and I love sharing this curriculum with my students each day in our classroom and lab.</h4></h3>
                <h3>Fun Fact: <h4> I have self taught myself all of the instruments I play except for the saxophone. I took 8 years of band from 5th grade to senior year to learn the saxophone. I can play the acoustic guitar, ukulele, bass guitar, drum set, djembe, cajon, spoons, and am currently attempting to learn the banjo. Emphasis on attempting.</h4></h3>
